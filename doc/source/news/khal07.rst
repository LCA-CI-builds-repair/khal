============
:date: 2015-11-24

The latest version of khal has been released: [khal v0.7.0](https://lostpackets.de/khal/downloads/khal-0.7.0.tar.gz) (as always, also on [PyPI](https://pypi.org)).

This release brings a lot of new features, thanks to an ever-increasing number of new contributors (welcome everyone!). One of the most requested features, highlighting of days with events, has been implemented (disabled by default due to performance reasons, startup performance improvements are in progress). Other new features include duplicating events (in ikhal), prettier event display (also in ikhal), and a better zsh completion file.
